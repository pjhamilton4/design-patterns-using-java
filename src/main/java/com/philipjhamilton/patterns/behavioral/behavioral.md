# Behavioral Design Patterns
Design patters that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. Doing this ensures there is flexibility in carrying out communication.

## Types

- ### Chain of responsibility
    #### Intent
    1. Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more
        than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving 
        objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
    2. Launch-and-leave requests with a single processing pipeline that contains many possible handlers.
    3. An OO linked list with recursive traversal.
        
- ### Command
- ### Interpreter
- ### Iterator
- ### Mediator
- ### Memento
- ### Null Object
- ### Observer
- ### State
- ### Strategy
- ### Template method
- ### Visitor

## Rules of thumb

1. Behavioral patterns are concerned with the assignment of responsibilities between objects, or, encapsulating behavior in an object and delegating requests to it.
